# Schr√∂dinger's App

This is a template application designed for training purposes in building full-stack, distributable, monolithic applications. It includes a minimal contact application that, by default, runs entirely in the web browser but can also be distributed across multiple servers.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run standalone
```

Then, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Next Steps

These will be explained during the workshop or training session.
